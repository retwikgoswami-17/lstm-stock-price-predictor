<h1>7-Day Stock Price Predictor using LSTM</h1>

This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict the next 7 days of stock prices by analyzing the patterns and trends in the previous 240 days of stock price data. The app loads pretrained LSTM models and scalers for each stock eliminating the need for users to retrain models from scratch. This significantly reduces computation time and enables users to instantly view predictions, making the system efficient and easy to use.
